    <h3>The Data Driven Organization - the new secular trend</h3>

    <p>
    The rising importance of data in organizations over the last two decades is undeniable.   Organizations across all sectors are increasingly undergoing deep transformation and restructuring towards data-driven operations.  Looking back, we can identify two earlier trends which brought us to the data-driven organization.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the 2000’s with the rise of the Web, and driven by Moore’s Law, organizations of all sizes could for the first time easily capture and process massive data collections using commodity distributed computing platforms such as Hadoop.  Big Data became democratized.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the 2010’s, with the rise of Big Data and dropping prices in GPU’s, organizations could increasingly perform sophisticated data analytics and extract value from their data using commodity machine learning solutions such as TensorFlow.  Data analytics and the AI revolution became democratized.
    </p>
<p>
    The Big Data trend placed increasing importance for organizations on being able to collect and harness data.   As this trend matured, organizations which identified and developed the role of Data Engineer had a competitive advantage.  The AI revolution has lead to the vital need for organizations to be able to draw value from their data.  This lead to the rise of the Data Scientist as a critical role.  
<p>
The AI revolution and the rise of cloud computing make possible the shift to the data-driven organization.  In the data-driven organization, the central role of data highlights the need for reliable and clean data.  If you don’t have clean and reliable data, your AI, machine learning and analytics are worthless: garbage in, garbage out.  Unreliable, erroneous, and incomplete data lead to critical bottlenecks in processing pipelines and, ultimately, service failures, which are disastrous for the competitive performance of the organization.   
<p>
Currently, the responsibility for making data reliable is implicitly shared between the data engineer and data scientist roles.  Given its central importance, those organizations which recognize and react to the need for reliable data will have the advantage in the coming decade.
<p>
We argue that the technologies for reliable, clean, meaningful, beautiful data are driven by distinct concerns and expertise which complement those of the data scientist and the data engineer.  Those organizations which identify the central importance of meaningful, explainable, reproducible, and maintainable data will be at the forefront of the democratization of reliable data.   We call the new role which must be developed to fill this critical need the Knowledge Scientist.
